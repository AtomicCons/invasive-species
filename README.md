# Invasive Species Dataset

## Purpose
The purpose of this repo is to create a robust dataset of known invasive species. This list grows every year and so should this dataset.
Why not use other datasets? I have not found a Federal Dataset based in JSON that is easily retrievable.



## Contributing

Anyone is free to contribute.  I will be monitoring changes and accepting pull requests.
Please make sure you are only adding **Invasive Species** to this dataset.
**Multi-Country**: Please create new folders for each country that you are adding invasive species too.
